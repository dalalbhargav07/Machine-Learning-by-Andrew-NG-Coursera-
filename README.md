# Machine-Learning-by-Andrew-NG-Coursera (Jan 2017 - Jan 2018)

The Machine Learning course by Andrew NG is a great learning experience about Machine learning Concepts along with data mining and statistical pattern recognition concepts.

Following were some of the topics covered in the course:
* Supervised learning 
    * Linear Regression
    * Logistic Regression 
    * Support Vector Machines(SVM),
    
    * Neural Networks
* Unsupervised learning
    * Clustering
    * Dimensionality Reduction
    * Recommender System
    * Intoduction to Deep Learning
* Best practices in machine learning
    * Bias/Variance theory
    * Innovation process in machine learning and AI
    
The course has also covered the techniques to apply learning algorithms to building smart robots (perception, control), text understanding (web search, anti-spam), computer vision, medical informatics, audio, database mining, and other areas.
